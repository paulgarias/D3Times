					<h3>Risk of depression with unemployment class </h3>
					<p>The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle noted that human beings exhibit flourishing when they are participating in activity. One area where people are at times at a deficity from activity towards a particular end (for example, financial independence or sustainance) is unemployment. </p>
					<p>The data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provides information about the percentage of the population that has been informed by a medical professional that they have depression and also asks what the employment status of each respondent is. With this information, we can tease out patterns that are worthy of exploring for causes.</p>
					<p>Two items with the highest correlations are the inability to work and retirement. The one with the least correlation is when a person is a homemaker. The indication is that being a homemaker does not seem to contribute to high probability of depression; this does not necessarily mean that there are not other risks that show that depression among homemakers is low.</p>
